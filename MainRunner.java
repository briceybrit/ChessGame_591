/**
 * Below is what I did for/with Keith
 */
//With Keith:
//1)	Peter initiated empty git folder
//2)	Pulled Keith’s git repository from GitHub
//3)	Peter made a change to a file
//4)	Pushed it to Keith’s repository on GitHub. Worked, check.
//5)	I made a change to a text file
//6)	Keith made a change to the same file
//7)	I pushed it online
//8)	Keith could then not push his, so he pulled it? Remerged it?
//9)	Keith could view both his and my changes, and rectified the changes.
//10)	Then he pushed the new version online
//11)	Peter downloaded the rectified file.
